# Progressive Web Apps with React
This is the code repository for [Progressive Web Apps with React](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/progressive-web-apps-react?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788297554), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
For years, the speed and power of web apps have lagged behind native applications. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) aim to solve this by bridging the gap between the web apps and native apps, delivering a host of exciting features. Simultaneously, React is fast becoming the go-to solution for building modern UIs, combines ease of development with performance and capability. Combining React with PWA technology will make it easy for you to build a fast, beautiful, and functional web app.

After an introduction and brief overview of the goals of PWAs, the book moves on to setting up the application structure. From there, it covers the Webpack build process and the process of creating React components. Also, learn how to set up the backend database and authentication solution to communicate with Firebase and how to work with React Router. Next, you will create and configure your web app manifest, making your PWA installable on mobile devices. Then, get introduced to service workers and see how they work as we configure the app to send push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging. We also, explore the App Shell pattern, a key concept in PWAs, and its advantages regarding efficient performance.

Finally, you’ll learn how to add ofﬂine capabilities to the app with caching and confirm your progress by auditing your PWA with Lighthouse. Also, explore helper libraries and shortcuts to help you save time, and understand the future of PWA development.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import LoginContainer from './LoginContainer';
import './app.css';


class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return <LoginContainer />
  }
}

export default App;
```

All you require is a computer that can run Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/), a text editor for writing code, and the latest version of the Chrome browser. If you want to test your application on mobile, you'll also need an Android or iOS phone.
